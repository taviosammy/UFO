# UFO
# Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the project is to create a webpage that allows a user to filter a data UFO database using different criteria.

# Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

The process starts by identifying the input boxes to the left of the page.

There are placeholder examples to guide users on what the inputs should look like.  You can enter more than one input to filter the table.

# Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development. 

The project overall works as intended. An area of improvement is being able to enter input regardless of capitalization.  Also currently the inputs have to match exactly with the data values to return results.  For Example, typing 'lon' in the city search bar will return 0 results, but typing 'london (canada)' will return 1 result.
